Title - "Hop To It" a brewery directory

Proposal/Project Description Hop To It is an app that a user can interact with to find a Brewery based on their location. The user will have an option to search based on the IP address geolocation, or city. After the user searches, the app will populate a list of Breweries that are nearby. The user can then click on a brewery to get a pop up modal that gives a link to the brewery's website and a link to google map marker display.

User Story: As a user who likes to drink beer I want to locate a brewery with my preferences for beer and location So I can have a good brewery experience
